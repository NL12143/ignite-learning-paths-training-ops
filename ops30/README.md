# OPS30: Learning From Failure

![Learning Path](https://img.shields.io/badge/Learning%20Path-OPS-fe5e00?logo=microsoft)

## Session Abstract

Incidents will happen—there’s no doubt about that. The key question is whether you will treat them as a learning opportunity to make your operations practice better or just as a loss of time, money, and reputation.  

In this session, you’ll dive into one of the most important topics for improving reliability: how to learn from failure. We’ll listen in on one of Tailwind Traders post-incident reviews, often called a postmortem so we can see how it is done. You’ll learn how to shape and run this process so it actually yields value from something that would ordinarily be just a failure. After this session, you’ll be able to build a key feedback loop in your organization that turns unplanned outages into opportunities
